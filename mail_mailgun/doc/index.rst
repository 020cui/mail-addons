Usage
=====

First we should register on mailgun.com.
After registgration there will be one domain available. E.g. sandbox5543f1479be64e5aac193406b4cdccf8.mailgun.org.
From this point we could already use API calls to mailgun API. There is API key on the
https://mailgun.com/app/domains/sandbox5543f1479be64e5aac193406b4cdccf8.mailgun.org page.
We can do all operations using mailgun API if we know our API key. More about it
on https://documentation.mailgun.com/.

There is 'Add New Domain' on the https://mailgun.com/app/domains to add new domains.
All domains that we add manually should be verified.
After adding your domain you will see the https://mailgun.com/app/domains/<yourdomain>/verify page
with instructions on how to verify and use new domain.

To receive incoming messages we specify so called routes on mailgun.
You can see more about the routes here https://documentation.mailgun.com/user_manual.html#receiving-forwarding-and-storing-messages
